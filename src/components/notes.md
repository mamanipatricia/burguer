### components using useState and components going into the components folder are dumb or presentational components that don't manage state. No matter if they were created as a class but don't use the state or if they are functional components that aren't using hooks.

### En react is good to create granular components and not big chunks.

Showing Error Messages
We're not showing any error messages in our form, but you can of course easily add some.

The form inputs (<Input />  component) already receives the information whether it's invalid or not. You could of course easily add some conditionally rendered element inside of that component.

For example (inside <Input />  component function):

// all the other code from the videos
 
let validationError = null;
if (props.invalid && props.touched) {
    validationError = <p>Please enter a valid value!</p>;
}
 
return (
     <div className={classes.Input}>
         <label className={classes.Label}>{props.label}</label>
         {inputElement}
         {validationError}
     </div>
 );
This could of course be finetuned. You could also pass the value type (e.g. "email address" ) as a prop:

validationError = <p>Please enter a valid {props.valueType}</p>; 

You could also receive the complete error message as a prop:

validationError = <p>{props.errorMessage}</p>; 

And of course, also don't forget to style the messages if you want to do that:

validationError = <p className={classes.ValidationError}>{props.errorMessage}</p>;

In your CSS file, you could have:

.ValidationError {
    color: red;
    margin: 5px 0;
}
